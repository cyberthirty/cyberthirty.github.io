## Description

Hacking operating systems are specialized platforms designed for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and network security assessments. One of the most popular choices in this field is **Kali Linux**, a Debian-based distribution that comes pre-installed with numerous security tools tailored for tasks such as information gathering, network analysis, vulnerability assessment, and forensic analysis. Notable pre-installed tools include Metasploit, Wireshark, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

## Requirements

### Hardware
- A powerful computer with sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, and Storage)
- Network Interface Cards (NICs) for connectivity
- Ample storage, preferably SSD for better performance

### Virtualization Software
- A hypervisor such as VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM

### Operating Systems
- **Kali Linux** or **ParrotSec** for penetration testing
- **Metasploitable** and other vulnerable VMs for practice
- **Windows Server/Desktop** for simulating real-world scenarios

### Networking
- A router for network segmentation
- A managed switch for VLANs
- A firewall for traffic control and security

### Wireless Network
- A wireless router or access point for testing wireless security

### Lab Topology Design
- Segmentation into different network segments (DMZ, internal network, etc.)
- Isolation from the production network to prevent unintended disruptions

### Security Tools
- **Vulnerability Scanner:** OpenVAS, Nessus
- **Exploitation Frameworks:** Metasploit and others
- **Packet Sniffers:** Wireshark
- **IDS/IPS:** For monitoring network traffic

### Logging and Monitoring
- A syslog server for log collection
- A SIEM solution for log analysis

## Setup Instructions

1. **Hardware Setup:** Ensure your computer meets the hardware requirements.
2. **Virtualization Software:** Install and configure your chosen hypervisor.
3. **Operating Systems:** Install Kali Linux, Metasploitable, and Windows systems.
4. **Networking:** Set up the router, switch, and firewall for effective network segmentation.
5. **Wireless Network:** Configure a separate wireless network for testing wireless security.
6. **Security Tools:** Install and configure your vulnerability scanners, exploitation frameworks, and more.
7. **Logging and Monitoring:** Set up a syslog server and SIEM solution for effective log management.
8. **Documentation:** Thoroughly document your lab topology and configurations for future reference.
